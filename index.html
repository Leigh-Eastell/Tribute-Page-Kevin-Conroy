Batman for me growing up was constantly rewatching Batman The Movie (1966 version) on VHS. I want to stress I was born some twenty years after this film came out. But I wasn't aloud to watch the Micheal Keaton versions as it "too dark" I would have been four when Danny DeVito donned the stage as Oswald Cobblepot, probably just as well I stuck to my sticker album instead.

But later that same year another "child friendly" version came to our tv screens on saturday mornings Batman The Animated Series. From the instant the WB logo morphed into spotlights the action started, an explosive and engrossing intro with quite a dark undertone. Was this what I'd been waiting for? YES!
