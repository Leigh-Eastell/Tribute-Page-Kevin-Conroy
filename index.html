Batman for me growing up was constantly rewatching Batman The Movie (1966 version) on VHS. I want to stress I was born some twenty years after this film came out. But I wasn't aloud to watch the Micheal Keaton versions as it "too dark" I would have been four when Danny DeVito donned the stage as Oswald Cobblepot, probably just as well I stuck to my sticker album instead.

But later that same year another "child friendly" version came to our tv screens on saturday mornings Batman The Animated Series. From the instant the WB logo morphed into spotlights the action started, an explosive and engrossing intro with quite a dark undertone. Was this what I'd been waiting for? YES!

From the moment you see Batman taking down two bank robbers in the intro you just get a sense of this is it. This is what I've been waiting for. 
What Kevin brought to the franchise was his incredible voice. He appitemised the Bruce Wayne/Batman role without the unneccessary need to sound like he has laryngitis when masked as the latter.

I was fortunate enough to have grown up with a kickass superhero, and have subsequently watched them since. Even getting my children involved in watching them. This animated series is absolutley the bases of my Batman fandom.
